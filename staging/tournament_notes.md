You may have to reload your page to get new results when they come out a few minutes after a round has finished.  Data entry is manual at this point, so it's not going to be immediate.

Probabilities are estimates based on many rounds of simulating the tournament.  For the official tournament standings/round results, please use https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vT7ppVBin5ZmOdpbEcKpgUCcQFPuKdf9f0ZG1zKXS2h2A34t-AnFto6HWgOvx0wHL2a3pux_-McV1Zg/pubhtml
